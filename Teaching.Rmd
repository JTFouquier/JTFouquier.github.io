During my PhD I have had the opportunity to assist in teaching several different classes ranging from bioinformatic workshops to macromolecular virology.
I take great pride in teaching and always ensure that the topics being taught are approachable from a broad range of different learning styles. I really enjoy taking complex topics in bioinformatics, computer science, or molecular biology and explaining them in more digestible formats.


Below I have included my various teaching experiences as well as several different microbiome workshop materials I had developed for the 2021 Microbiome Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop. For further information on my teaching responsibilities checkout my [CV](CV.html)


Workshop Experience:

  - I have had the pleasure of teaching at the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops series. Below are the links to the various content that I developed for this workshop series.
  
    - [PICRUst2 Tutorial](https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/CBW-2021-PICRUSt2-Tutorial)
    
    - [Metagenomic Shotgun Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/CBW-2021-Metagenomic-Taxonomic-and-Functional-Composition-Tutorial)
    
    - [Statistical Analysis of Microbiome Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jclb5g1ZUlY&ab_channel=JacobNearing)


Teaching Experience:

  - I helped teach several different classes offered at Dalhousie University. These include both hands on laboratory demonstrations and lectures.
  
      - MICI 3114: Virology
      
      - MICI 2100: Introduction to Microbiology and Immunology
      
      - BIOC 3400: Nucleic Acid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology


Supervisory Experience:

  - During my PhD I have had the opportunity to supervise an undergraduate studentâ€™s honors project examining the prevalence of anti-microbial resistance genes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
